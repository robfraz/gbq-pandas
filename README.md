# gbq-pandas
Simple tools for working with Google BigQuery and Pandas DataFrames

I created this as an alternative to the pandas-gbq project (https://github.com/pydata/pandas-gbq), which seems to have some fairly major issues that (in the short term, at least) aren't getting fixed.

## Prerequisites

Currently this has only been tested with Python 3.6.  See the `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies.
